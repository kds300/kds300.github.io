I'm Kevin Sargent, a Physics PhD student at Penn State.
I've defended my dissertation and am graduating this winter.
After studying neuromorphic computing and audio recognition, I'm looking for my next step as I start my career.

# What I'm Doing

## [STMNet](/projects/spiking_template_matching)
Spike Template Matching Network: Spiking network which recognizes spatio-temporal spike sequences.
Built using the Lava framework for modeling spiking neural networks.

Paper coming soon!
